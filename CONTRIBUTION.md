## How to Contribute

Thanks for considering contributing to `aima-javascript`! We are building *visualizations* of the concepts in AIMA, along with Javascript algorithms. Whether you are an aspiring [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5663121491361792/) student, or an independent contributor, here is a guide to how you can help:

- First, read and understand the code to get a feel for the extent and the style.
- Pick a chapter from the list below that's not already being worked on, and state your intent to work on it the [Division of work](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-javascript/issues/27) thread.
- Alternatively, look at the [issues](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-javascript/issues) and pick one to work on.
- Please squash all commits into a single commit.

Notes :

* Status :
    * Completed : Already implemented algorithm and have animation
    * Not completed : Have algorithm space but not implemented algorithm and not have animation
    * Not implemented : Not have any algorithm space or header
    * Algorithm Only : Already implemented algorithm but not have animation
    * On Working : Already handled and in progress
